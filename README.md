What is LiDAR Point Cloud Processing:

- A point cloud is a discrete set of data points in space. The points may represent a 3D shape or object. Each point position has its set of Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z). Point clouds are generally produced by 3D scanners or by photogrammetry software, which measure many points on the external surfaces of objects around them.

- LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging. Aerial LiDAR uses LASER to calculate the distance between the point and the drone (emitting laser) using the same principle as SONAR.

- Each point cloud contains a considerable amount of individual points.

- The two most common tasks in LiDAR point cloud processing is : Semantic and Instance Segmentation

- Semantic Segmentation - Labelling of each point in a general category

- Instance Segmentation - Labelling each point into an object id specifying an individual object within that category

What is DALES:

- DALES object dataset offers a meticulously hand labelled dataset that contains 8 semantic object categories and over 20K hand - labelled instances.

- DALES object presents one of the most extensive segmentation dataset taken with aerial lidar and which provides both urban and rural scenes.

- DALES Object covers over ten square kilometres of aerial lidar with the eight object categories: ground, vegetation, buildings, cars, trucks, powerlines, poles and fences.
- Instance segmentation is provided for all man made objects within the dataset.
